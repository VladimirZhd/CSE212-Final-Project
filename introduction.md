## What is it all about?

Hi, my name is Vova Zhdanov. I am a student at Brigham Young University - Idaho. This tutorial  
is a part of my Data Structure class. I will reflect on everything I've learned in the class, and  
will try to help others to learn about some of the data structures.  
To go through this tutorial you'll need a basic understanding of Python programming language, access to text editor or IDE (I will use VSCode, but you are free to use your favorite editor).

Good luck with your learning!
