## `Lets's Talk About Trees`

Tree represents the nodes connected by edges. We will discuss binary tree or binary search tree specifically.

Binary Tree is a special data structure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have a maximum of two children. A binary tree has the benefits of both an ordered array and a linked list as search is as quick as in a sorted array and insertion or deletion operation are as fast as in linked list.
